# Understanding BMI: What Your Number Really Means

Body Mass Index (BMI) is one of the most widely used health metrics, but it's often misunderstood. Here's what you need to know.

## What Is BMI?

BMI is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in meters squared:

**BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)²**

Try our [free BMI Calculator](/tools.html#bmi-calculator) with a visual gauge and instant health category classification.

## BMI Categories

| BMI Range | Category |
|-----------|----------|
| Below 18.5 | Underweight |
| 18.5 – 24.9 | Normal Weight |
| 25.0 – 29.9 | Overweight |
| 30.0 – 34.9 | Obese (Class I) |
| 35.0 – 39.9 | Obese (Class II) |
| 40.0+ | Obese (Class III) |

## Limitations of BMI

BMI doesn't distinguish between muscle and fat. A muscular athlete might have a high BMI despite being very healthy. Other factors BMI doesn't account for include:

- **Body composition** (muscle vs. fat ratio)
- **Fat distribution** (visceral vs. subcutaneous)
- **Age and gender** differences
- **Bone density** variations

## Better Health Indicators

Use BMI alongside other metrics for a fuller picture:

1. **Waist circumference** — Men >102cm and Women >88cm indicate higher risk
2. **Waist-to-hip ratio** — More predictive of cardiovascular disease
3. **Body fat percentage** — Available via smart scales or DEXA scans
4. **Blood pressure and cholesterol** — Key cardiovascular markers

## The Bottom Line

BMI is a useful screening tool, not a diagnosis. If you're concerned about your BMI, consult a healthcare professional who can assess your overall health picture.
