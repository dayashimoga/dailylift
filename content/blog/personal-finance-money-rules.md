# Personal Finance 101: 5 Money Rules Everyone Should Follow

Managing money doesn't require an MBA. These five simple rules will put you ahead of 90% of people when it comes to financial health.

## Rule 1: The 50/30/20 Budget

Divide your after-tax income into three buckets:
- **50% Needs** — rent, food, utilities, insurance
- **30% Wants** — dining out, entertainment, hobbies
- **20% Savings & Debt** — emergency fund, investments, loan repayments

Use our [Bill Splitter](/tools.html#bill-splitter) to divide shared expenses with roommates or partners.

## Rule 2: Build an Emergency Fund

Before investing a single rupee, build an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses. Keep it in a high-yield savings account for easy access.

## Rule 3: Avoid High-Interest Debt

Credit card debt at 30-40% annual interest is financial poison. Pay off credit cards in full every month. If you have existing debt, use the avalanche method (pay highest interest first) or snowball method (pay smallest balance first).

## Rule 4: Start Investing Early

Thanks to compound interest, starting early beats starting big:
- ₹5,000/month from age 25 at 12% = **₹5.3 crore** by age 60
- ₹10,000/month from age 35 at 12% = **₹3.5 crore** by age 60

Starting 10 years earlier with half the investment produced 50% more wealth.

## Rule 5: Track Your Spending

You can't improve what you don't measure. Track every expense for one month — you'll be surprised where your money goes. Simple spreadsheets or apps like Money Manager work well.

## The Bottom Line

Financial freedom isn't about earning more — it's about managing what you have wisely. Follow these five rules consistently, and you'll build lasting wealth regardless of your income level.
