# The Complete Guide to Splitting Bills Fairly

Splitting bills shouldn't be stressful. Whether it's a dinner with friends or shared household expenses, here's how to handle it gracefully.

## The Equal Split

The simplest approach: divide the total equally. This works best when everyone ordered similarly priced items. Our [free bill splitter tool](/tools.html#bill-splitter) makes this instant — just enter the total, number of people, and tip percentage.

## The Itemized Split

When orders vary significantly, splitting by actual consumption is fairer. Some restaurants provide itemized receipts that make this easy.

## Handling Tips

In many cultures, tips are expected:
- **India:** 5-10% is standard at restaurants
- **USA:** 15-20% is customary
- **Europe:** Service charge is often included

**Pro tip:** Calculate the tip on the pre-tax amount, then split the total (bill + tip) equally.

## Digital Tools Make It Easy

Gone are the days of awkward mental math. Use our [Bill Splitter](/tools.html#bill-splitter) to calculate splits in seconds — no app download required, works entirely in your browser.

## Group Expense Etiquette

1. **Discuss before ordering** if budget matters
2. **Don't nitpick small differences** — good relationships are worth more
3. **Offer to Venmo/UPI** for easier settlements
4. **Take turns treating** for recurring group dinners

The best bill-splitting strategy is whatever keeps friendships intact and wallets comfortable.
