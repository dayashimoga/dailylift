# Digital Minimalism: How to Reclaim Your Attention

The average person checks their phone 96 times per day. That's once every 10 minutes. If you feel like technology controls you more than you control it, digital minimalism might be the answer.

## What Is Digital Minimalism?

Coined by Cal Newport, digital minimalism is a philosophy of technology use where you focus on a small number of carefully selected online activities that support your values, and miss out on everything else.

## The Cost of Digital Clutter

- **Attention fragmentation** — constant context switching reduces IQ by up to 10 points
- **Sleep disruption** — blue light and stimulating content delay sleep onset
- **Comparison anxiety** — social media feeds engineered to trigger envy
- **Time loss** — the average person spends 2.5 hours daily on social media

## Steps to Digital Minimalism

### 1. Audit Your Apps
List every app on your phone. For each, ask: "Does this directly support something I deeply value?" Delete the rest.

### 2. Turn Off Notifications
Keep notifications only for phone calls and direct messages from close contacts. Everything else can wait.

### 3. Schedule Check-In Times
Instead of constantly checking email and social media, schedule 2-3 specific times per day.

### 4. Reclaim Mornings and Evenings
No screens for the first 30 minutes after waking and the last 60 minutes before sleep.

### 5. Find Analog Alternatives
- **Instead of scrolling:** read a physical book
- **Instead of Reddit:** have a real conversation
- **Instead of YouTube:** go for a walk

## The Payoff

People who practice digital minimalism report:
- Higher quality sleep
- Deeper friendships
- More creative output
- Reduced anxiety
- More free time
