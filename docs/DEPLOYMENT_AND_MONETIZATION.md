## 1. Hosting & Domain Setup (Netlify)

DailyLift uses a Zero-Cost Jamstack Architecture. It is hosted on Netlify, which serves the static HTML/CSS/JS files globally for free.

### Step-by-Step Configuration:
1. **Purchase a Domain:** Buy a domain name (e.g., `quickutils.top`) from a registrar (Namecheap, Porkbun, GoDaddy).
2. **Deploy on Netlify:**
   - Log into [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/).
   - Click **Add new site** > **Import an existing project**.
   - Connect your GitHub account and select your `dailylift` repository.
   - Configure the Build settings:
     - **Build command:** `npm run build`
     - **Publish directory:** `dist`
   - Click **Deploy Site**.
3. **Configure the Custom Domain:**
   - In Netlify, go to **Domain management** > **Add custom domain**.
   - Enter your domain name.
   - Netlify will provide 4 custom **Name Servers** (e.g., `dns1.p01.nsone.net`).
   - Log into your domain registrar and replace your domain's default Name Servers with the 4 Netlify servers.
4. **SSL Certificate:** Once DNS propagation finishes (can take 24 hours), Netlify automatically provisions a free Let's Encrypt SSL certificate.

## 2. Traffic Analytics (Google Analytics 4)

Google Analytics (GA4) tracks your website visitors, page views, and user behavior.

### Step-by-Step Configuration:
1. **Create an Account:** Go to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) and sign in.
2. **Create a Property:** Set up a new property using your website URL.
3. **Get the Measurement ID:** Create a **Web Data Stream** for your site. Once created, copy the **Measurement ID** (format: `G-XXXXXXXXXX`).
4. **Integration in DailyLift:**
   - Open all HTML files in `src/` (`index.html`, `tools.html`, `blog.html`, `about.html`) and the builder template (`scripts/build.js`).
   - Locate the Google Analytics `<script>` tag in the `<head>`.
   - Replace the placeholder `G-QPDP38ZCCV` with your actual Measurement ID.
   - Commit and push the changes.

## 3. Passive Income (Google AdSense)

Google AdSense injects contextual banner ads into the website.

### Step-by-Step Configuration:
1. **Apply for AdSense:** Go to [Google AdSense](https://adsense.google.com/start/) and sign up.
2. **Add Your Site:** In the AdSense dashboard, navigate to **Sites** and add your domain.
3. **Get Your Publisher ID:** Note your Publisher ID (e.g., `ca-pub-5193703345853377`). This is already integrated into the `adsbygoogle.js` script tag in the `<head>` of all HTML pages.
4. **Generate Ad Units for Tracking:**
   - In AdSense, go to **Ads** > **By ad unit** > **Display ads**.
   - Create distinct ad units so you can track revenue per page type (e.g., "Homepage Banner", "Tools Page", "Blog Posts").
   - Click **Create** and copy the `data-ad-slot` number (e.g., `2246027256`) from the generated code snippet.
5. **Integration in DailyLift:**
   - Open all `.html` files and `scripts/build.js`.
   - Locate the `<ins class="adsbygoogle">` tags.
   - Replace the `data-ad-slot` value with the corresponding slot ID you generated. Note: The codebase currently has specific IDs integrated (`2246027256` for index, `2573330311` for tools, `8571762456` for blog, `1479740496` for about). Update these with your own if they change.
6. **Wait for Approval:** Google takes 3–14 days to review and approve the site. Ads will remain blank until approved.

## 4. Affiliate Income (Amazon Associates)

Amazon Associates allows you to earn commissions when users click your links and buy recommended products (like books).

### Step-by-Step Configuration:
1. **Sign Up:** Create a free account at the [Amazon Associates Central](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/).
2. **Get Tracking ID:** Note your Store/Tracking ID (e.g., `quickutils-21`).
3. **Generate Affiliate Links:**
   - Search for the product (e.g., *Atomic Habits*) on Amazon.
   - Use the **Amazon SiteStripe** toolbar at the top of the page to generate a "Text" link.
4. **Integration in DailyLift:**
   - Open `src/index.html`.
   - Locate the **Books We Recommend** section.
   - Replace the standard book `href` links with your generated Amazon affiliate links.

## 5. Digital Product Sales (Gumroad)

Gumroad is used to sell digital products directly to your audience (e.g., the PDF eBook of 500+ Quotes).

### Step-by-Step Configuration:
1. **Create an Account:** Sign up at [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/).
2. **Create a Product:**
   - Go to **Products** > **New Product**.
   - Select "Digital Product".
   - Set the Price (you can set it to $0+ to allow "Pay what you want", offering it for free to build an email list).
   - Upload your PDF file (e.g., `DailyLift-500-Quotes.pdf`).
3. **Get the Checkout Link:** Publish the product and copy the share URL (e.g., `https://yourname.gumroad.com/l/quotes`).
4. **Integration in DailyLift:**
   - Open `src/index.html`.
   - Locate the download button: `<a href="#" id="downloadQuotePdf">📄 Download 500+ Quotes PDF (Free)</a>`.
   - Replace `#` with your Gumroad product URL. (Optionally, use the Gumroad overlay script for an in-page checkout).

## 6. Social Media Automation (Mastodon / Fediverse)

DailyLift automatically posts a random daily quote to a Mastodon social profile every day at midnight UTC, powered entirely by a free GitHub Action.

### Step-by-Step Configuration:
1. **Create a Mastodon Account:** Go to a server like [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social) and create your brand account.
2. **Generate API Token:**
   - In Mastodon, go to **Preferences** (Gear Icon) > **Development** > **New Application**.
   - Name the app (e.g., "DailyLift Bot").
   - Under Scopes, you only need to check `write:statuses`.
   - Click **Submit**, then click on the app name to view the **Access Token**. Copy this token.
3. **Add Secrets to GitHub:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository on github.com.
   - Navigate to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions** > **New repository secret**.
   - Create `MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN` and paste your token.
   - Create `MASTODON_INSTANCE_URL` and set it to your server (e.g., `mastodon.social`).
4. **How It Works:** The GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/update-content.yml`) runs daily. It seamlessly fetches a quote from ZenQuotes via `scripts/fetch-quote.js` and securely posts it to Mastodon using `scripts/post-social.js`. It does not commit code back to the repository, meaning zero Netlify build minutes are consumed.
